## A. Done

* Implemented linear quadratic cost model to respond to reviewer : $C(E) = c_0 + c_1 E + c_2 E^2$
  -> This should be the main model we consider, as it shows that monopoly results can very much depend on the cost structure, and the cartel may not do well. 
  
  (i) reconstructed the total cost function
  
  (ii) found values that are close to the actual estimated cost and 
  
  (iii) feature different evolution scenarios, including different degrees of importance of the quadratic term. This should fix the whole cost discussion, and mimics the results from Pereau and Doyen, 2021. 

* Explained demand scheme in the appendix to respond to reviewer

## B. Left to do

### 1. Core choices for modeling

* Define what is the discount rate chosen by operators in here : if we focus on the steady state and only use contemporaneous profits, what does that mean? 
  
  (i) Defined a capitalization interest rate of $10%$ for aquaculture, changed the cost parameter a little, but better. 
  
  (ii) Remain to clarify assumptions for monopolist in terms of discount factor

* We may need to refer to an *explicit target in terms of population* (by referring to the MEY or MSY?) and the distance to it, to really satisfy the reviewers. Are there explicit policy guidelines? Like "we are closing the fishery to recover a population of 80% of carrying capacity"?

  * Solve with the reference point (Punto de Referencia Limite) in INAPESCA, 2020 : '[...] se considero un PRL conservador de 1.2 * K/2' p.68
  
  * Solve with no reference point and table output as in Englander and Costello (2023), saved under `bioeconomic_performance_table.csv` in `data/outputs`
  

### 2. Text modifications

* We should go with the LQ model, as it outlines the potential for a vertical monopoly to fare well, but also to lead to a drastic population decrease

* Concerning our approach with respect to the novelty of our work and contribution, I think we should stress the results from the Monopoly perspective, which we already do, and maybe tone down references to Bulte and Damania. We showed that their results only hold in certain circumstances, but we do indeed find a slightly worse scenario with price competition, which we rule out considering the profit motives. 

* In the *supplementary material* may need to clean stuff up, to refer only to : 

  * The linear quadratic model
  
  * Highlight the key equations as suggested by reviewers
  
  * And really target the message
  
  * Do the extensions for the linear quadratic model
  
* Check figure Julia did on Canvas and modify if need be

### 3. Code implementations

* Verify sensitivity analysis for linear quadratic model

* Clean the .rmd files
